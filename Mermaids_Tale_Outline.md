## ⚓ Captain's Quarters

### Puzzle 1: Captain's Desk and Mermaid Mirror
Players locate and unlock the Captain's ornate desk using subtle environmental clues. Inside, they find a mysterious scroll. Removing the scroll triggers a mystical activation of the Mermaid Mirror mounted nearby. The mirror glows and displays an ethereal image of a mermaid pointing toward a glowing symbol on the wall.

Players must recognize and touch this specific symbol to unlock the magnetic cuffs.

The scroll includes cryptic illustrations of the following icons:
- A mermaid
- A turtle
- A seahorse
- A boat (vessel)
- A trident
- A monkey
- A star constellation

Players will later use this scroll to match images to glyphs in the tomb.

**Materials:** Lockable desk drawer with hidden trigger, scroll prop (with symbolic iconography), wall-mounted mirror with rear projection or screen, symbol panel with capacitive or proximity sensor, Arduino controller.

---

### Puzzle 2: Magnetic Cuffs
Players begin restrained in magnetic cuffs aboard the Devil's Vessel. Once the correct symbol is touched, the cuffs are released. Immediately after, the Mermaid Mirror changes again, now showing a more vivid image of Evalee in mermaid form with a guardian monkey by her side.

She speaks a new cryptic line:

> **"Bring balance to the sea, and the sky shall guide you home."**

This reinforces the importance of elemental restoration and constellation imagery.

**Materials:** Magnetic cuffs, proximity sensors, LED indicators, mirror feedback trigger, Arduino controller.

## 🚢 Pirate Ship

### Puzzle 3: Sea Horse Dials
Players find three bronze compasses, each embedded in the ship's walls. Scattered across the room are three seahorse-shaped medallions—each uniquely sculpted and magnetized to fit into one specific compass. Players must insert and align each seahorse to the compass points. When all three are correctly set, the ship's navigation wheel unlocks.

**Materials:** Three compass housings with rotation sensors, seahorse medallions with magnetic bases or RFID, Arduino controllers, LED feedback, unlocking mechanism for pirate wheel.

---

### Puzzle 4: Pirate Wheel Navigation
With the compasses aligned, players now access the ship's pirate wheel. Turning it activates projected ocean scenes and a warning from Red Beard. Players steer the vessel toward the illuminated course.

During this sequence, Red Beard remarks:
> **"The Trident of the Deep… lost to time… without it, the sea's fate was sealed. Find it, and perhaps ye can set things right."**

This line establishes the mythical importance of the Trident early in the story.

**Materials:** Pirate wheel with rotary encoder, projection system, sound system, Arduino controller.

### Puzzle 5: Defending the Ship
Enemy ships appear. Players load and fire cannons. Each successful hit triggers immersive effects. Victory rewards players with the **first piece of the Mermaid's Compass Rose**.

**Materials:** Cannon props, cannonballs, smoke effects, Arduino controller, Compass Rose fragment prop.

---

### Puzzle 6: Balance Scale Puzzle
Players weigh leather spice pouches with a brass balance scale. They match spice names to barrels and place them in correct order based on rack weight labels. Success allows progression.

**Materials:** Brass scale with sensors, spice pouches with weights, barrels with labels and sensors.

---

### Puzzle 7: Rum Barrel Puzzle
Players locate Red Beard's secret rum recipe. Identifying and placing the correct barrels triggers Red Beard's voice and rewards them with the **second piece of the Mermaid's Compass Rose**.

**Materials:** Rum barrels, recipe prop, audio system, Compass Rose fragment prop.

---

### Puzzle 8: Wheel Map Puzzle
Players place both Compass Rose pieces onto the ship's mounted map. This activates hidden overlays revealing Evalee's route to Mermaid Cove. Navigation completes the Pirate Ship section.

**Materials:** Wall-mounted map, Compass Rose props, LED/projection system, pirate wheel interface.

---

## 🌿 Jungle

### Puzzle 1: Symbols in the Sand
Players align metal rings buried in sand based on poem clues. Successful alignment reveals **Monkey Totem 1**.

**Materials:** Sandbox, metal rings with sensors, hidden compartment, Arduino.

---

### Puzzle 2: Waterfall Labyrinth
Players direct water through a vertical maze using valves and jugs. Filling carved basins correctly reveals **Monkey Totem 2**.

**Materials:** Water-safe maze, valves, carved basins with level sensors, Arduino.

---

### Puzzle 3: Driftwood Assembly
Players restore a wall carving using driftwood pieces. Correct assembly reveals **Monkey Totem 3**.

**Materials:** Driftwood props with magnets, shrine wall panel.

## 🏛️ Ancient Ruins

> ⚠️ *Puzzles TBD — section to be developed.*

---

## 🐒 Monkey Tomb

### Puzzle 1: Hieroglyphic Decoding with Scroll Overlay
Placing all three Monkey Totems in the altar triggers wall movement, revealing the tomb and mural.

Inside the tomb, players see a faded mural with numerous symbols. They discover a torch nearby. Bringing the torch close causes only seven symbols to glow faintly:

- Mermaid
- Turtle
- Seahorse
- Boat
- Trident
- Monkey
- Stars

Players place the scroll (which has laser-cut holes) over the mural. When aligned, the glowing symbols appear through the holes, revealing which glyphs to press. Inputting these in any order solves the puzzle.

When the correct sequence is pressed, a **secret wall cabinet opens**, revealing **Poseidon's Trident** — glowing with power.

**Materials:** UV-reactive mural, UV torch prop, laser-cut scroll, touch-sensitive glyph panel, Arduino, hidden cabinet with motorized or magnetic release, LED-lit Trident prop.

---

## 🧜 Mermaid Cove (Finale)

### Puzzle 1: Mermaid's Shell Song
Players replicate a melody by touching glowing shell panels.

### Puzzle 2: Celestial Alignment
Players align celestial panels to match a constellation map. Using the Trident, they activate star patterns.

### Puzzle 3: Final Ritual
Trident is placed into a pedestal. Evalee appears, and the chamber transforms with water, light, and sound.

**Materials:** Touch-sensitive panels, constellation props, waterfall/projection system, LED effects.
